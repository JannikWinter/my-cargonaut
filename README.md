# MyCargonaut

MyCargonaut is a community driven web app solution to private cargo delivering. In short, MyCargonaut aims to be a
platform where users can offer to drive other user's cargo from point A to point B. Any monetary transactions will be
handled between users; MyCargonaut will not take a cent in cuts.

MyCargonaut was created in tandem with the THM computer science lecture KMS as the big programming project of the 
semester.

## Technologies

MyCargonaut uses a platera of different technologies to get the job done:

The whole backend is build on an union of `ES6 JavaScript` and `openjdk15 Java`, enabled via `Javalin 3.13`.

The front end is basic `HTML5` on a custom `Bootstrap 5.0.0` stylesheet as well as a few manual 
`CSS3` additions. MyCargonaut uses server-sided rendering via a relatively new template engine for Java:

Regarding code maintenance we are using `JUnit5` as well as `npm 7.5.2` for general testing, as well as tools like 
`TravisCI` and `HoundCI` for continuous deployment & delivery on GitHub.
